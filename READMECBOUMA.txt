Hello!

I made a requirements file if you want to do it that way, the only package you might be missing is "schedule" and maybe "seaborn" but I figured I may as well!
I've left some comments here and there, but I think it's all pretty self-explanatory, let me know if you have any queries!

I believe questions 1-3 are apparent from the code. Question 4 is supplied as a draw.io png and draw.io file. Questions 5-8 are answered by running the code with "main.py".

Regarding question 9A, I just set it on a schedule to run every 10 minutes. Since you only asked to describe it I haven't bothered to set
    it up to save every instance seperately. But doing this and only storing a day worth of data would be pretty straightforward. 
    We could have the big database ordered on timestamp, and then limit it to however many instances per station id.


Since I have 35 minutes left, I'm going to attempt the visualisation part, see if I can make it automate something nice in Pandas, though not
    entirely sure what will come of it!

Question 9B: I was fiddling with panda for a bit, but decided to just throw it into chatgpt, and adjusted it slight to make it look a bit better.
    I'm more than happy to do these things myself, but figured I'd rather submit it on time.


Thank you for your time, and I hope everything is to your liking!
